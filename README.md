This program is a part of my CFO journey and my thesis work on M&A for my ESSEC Executive MS in Financial Management and Management Control graduation. It provides a value range of the target using Montecarlo simulation and DCF. The program takes as inputs the financial statements, assumptions and scenarios of the target company and outputs a valuation report with sensitivity analysis and charts. The program is written in Python and uses pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries. The program is intended for educational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice or recommendation.# MCS
